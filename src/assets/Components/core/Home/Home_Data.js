      "StudyNotion is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) built using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Router on the frontend to deliver a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience. The application uses React Hook Form for efficient form handling and Axios for seamless API communication.\n\nOn the backend, StudyNotion is powered by Node.js and Express.js, following a RESTful API architecture with MongoDB and Mongoose for scalable database management. The platform implements JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC) for students and instructors, and bcrypt for secure password encryption. Media content such as course thumbnails and videos are managed using Cloudinary, while Razorpay / Stripe is integrated for secure course payments. Additional features like email notifications are handled using Nodemailer.\n\nThis LMS provides complete course creation, management, purchase, and consumption workflows, making StudyNotion a production-ready EdTech web application focused on scalability, performance, and user experience.",
